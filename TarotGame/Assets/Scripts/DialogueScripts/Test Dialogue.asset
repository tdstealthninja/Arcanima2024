  Text: 'This is test dialogue, thus I am using this time to not only not code the
    rest of this system but also to test how much I can type before I fill up the
    entire box in the inspector. It turns out [TextArea(10,15)] is pretty large for
    a box and should be good enough for any dialogue lines, not to mention the box
    stretches with the inspector window and thus with how I have it I only have this
    last line where I am typing last, or not because it seems to add a line before
    I even got close to the end and only now did the scroll bar has appeared so I
    shall stop typing now. '
